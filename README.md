P3 Projekt - Planning for sportsclubs 

As of right now the program uses a local database, which means a server must be downloaded and installed.

When the server is not installed, the program will still be able to run and create a tournament, however this tournament will not be saved and further features will not be available.

This version of the program will startup at the admin page, which means the login will be skipped. The final version delivered to Jetsmark IF will startup at the front page.
